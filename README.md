# Landing Page

Landing page developed under the same Odin template, using fonts, colors and sizes to give it the greatest possible similarity.

Made in HTML and CSS with VScode.

# REPOSITORY CONTENTS
    HTML File
    CSS File
    README.md

## How it was Made
First i had to download the images to see the example of the page and the parameters they should have.

Afterwards I created my html giving it classes to facilitate the elaboration of the design with CSS and little by little I added it to it.

I had difficulties because some boxes were not where they should be. By researching and seeing some other examples I managed to fix it.
